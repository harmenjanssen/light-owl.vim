# Light Owl vim colorscheme

This colorscheme is inspired by [Sarah Drasner's Light Owl theme for VS Code](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme), and also by the existing [Night Owl theme for vim by haishanh](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme).


## Usage

Load the theme using your favorite plugin manager. With [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) you would do this:

```
Plug 'harmenjanssen/light-owl.vim'
```

Then simply use it by calling `colorscheme`:

```
colorscheme lightowl
```

## Missing something?

Heck yes you're going to be missing something! I wrote this on a lazy Sunday morning and checked with some PHP files, CSS files, and a couple of Javascript files.  
I trial-and-errored Esilio's pre-baked list of Vim syntax groups, and I'm sure I've missed a couple or interpreted them incorrectly.

Pull Requests to polish this theme, or to add support for different languages are more than welcome.
